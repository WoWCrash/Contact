Hey, I saw that you were able to put a DK fix on the Legion repack.  ott deleted my comment, and I'm not quite sure why, but I wanted to try reaching out again and provide you with my Skype information in case you didn't mind sharing your fixes with me.  I'm trying to work on getting rogue combo finishers to work, and seeing how you implemented your fixes could give me some good information on how to move forward on that front.
